Which medal whould I obtain it???</p><p>All this questions I answerd it for myself during the exam itself, so the exam was about Big Data, Storage and Cloud Services. We was provied with a syllabus for each concept we should study, and the structure og the exam was about 90 points between MCQ, T or F and Select More Than One, during the exam I was have much confident when I select an answer of the question, the time of the exam was 3 hours and I finished it in 2.44 hours, then I submitted my answers and go away, I also want to mention that the exam hold in 3 different places related to Huawei Egypt and it&#x27;s not from home.</p><p>Two weeks ago I&#x27;ve received a call Huawei Egypt Team, told me that I was one from the top 9 students of cloud track, when I heard thi news I was so excited because this was good things from me because the top 9 students gonna recieve so much opportunity related to our future career and we also have an oppotunity to reach the final in China. I&#x27;m so happy to be from 9 student, I know now that I have to do my best pass the the selection exam and so much work to reach China final, so I hope I edit the article again when I achieve something bigger and move forward to next phase, I can&#x27;t wait, guys and see you later 👋</p></section></article><div></div><div class="margin-vert--xl"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog post page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/2021/02/06/2020-in-review"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Newer Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">« 2020 in Review</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/blog/2020/02/25/a-week-with-innovegypt"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Older Post</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">A Week with InnovEgypt »</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_3SO_"></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Professional</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamedsgap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">LinkedIn</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/mohamedsgap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Github</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Social</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/mohamedsgap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mohd_abdelnasser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Instagram</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="text--center"><div>Copyright © 2021, Mohamed Abdelnasser 👨🏽‍💻.</div></div></div></footer></div>
