Firsty I know it's a bit late to wite about 2020 in February of 2021, but anyway when I got some time for it, I didn't hesitate to do though, I know that 2020 was a very difficult year for all the world but for me it was a completly different for me, so let's get started. 

<!--truncate-->

*** Note *** As I'm writing this blog right now February 06, 2021_ I'll try to remember so events which happened in every month of thr last year and list them for every month.

#### January 
I remember of this month that i had my first term exams as final year computer science student, so most of the month I was feeling stressed becuase I want to pass at my exams and got a good GPA, Also in January that I set new goals I want to achieve, and some challenges I want to face.

#### February
In February, I was focusing in my mid-year vacation after finished my exams on improving my softawre development skills and building more side projects, also of course I got more time to study for my Facebook scholarship and Huawei ICT competition. I started to hear about COVID-19 but all things around me was pretty normal.

#### March
It was a completely different month, becuase COVID-19 was starting to spread in Egypt, so I srated to not to go to my college, all courses became online, and every one stayed home, by this decision, I became having more time for my scholarship and contribute to more open source project. Also to watch some series and football games. 

#### April, May, June
These three months was typically like each other, nothing exciting, everyone stayed home, and I was studying, building projects and applying for Interns and made 
some interviews. in these months I felt depressed, I think most people in the world was have the same feeling, many people lost their jobs, many students didn't know when they would graduate.

#### July 
In July, All what I remember is the in that month I was preparing for my final semaster exam at all in the middle of the month, so I was studing hard to get my Bachelor degree, also there was a challenge that  our exams would be held in the college so we had to go to college although of COVID-19 spreading.

#### August, September, October
In these months, I completed my scholarship, and finished my Huawei ICT competiton with a very high score and become one of the top 5 studnets in cloud computing track, I also started a training program powered by Facebook and Andela. Also I made some interviews for a software engineer position, I got some offers but I the most exciting one I gotm it was from CEQUENS where I work right now. I wanna mention something here that in August 13, it was my graduation project debate so the week before this debate was very stressfull a lot of hard work and collaboration was going though. 

#### November, December
These 2 months was the most exciting where I started my first job as full time software engineer, and facing new challenges and collaborating with amazing people who I work with in my team.


At the end, overall 2020 was a very good year for, and I hope to achieve more in 2021, I'm gonna manage to write more about my experience in this blog every weekend.

See you soon ðŸ‘‹
